submitted by: Rohit Kumar (DA24S003)

#### Understanding the Problem
The goal of this assignment is twofold:
- Train a CNN model from scratch and learn how to tune hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. And visualize the filters.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model

#### Allowed Libraries
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PyTorch Lightning (provided fp16 mixed precision training and wandb integration)

This Assignment is based on iNaturalist dataset. According to the problem statement, problem statement is divided into various parts:
- **PART A**: Training from scratch, hyperparameter tuning and visualizing the filters
- **PART B**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model

Code related to corresponding parts will be accessible in the respective folders. And Instruction to run the run and reproduce the results are provided in REAMDE.md file in each folder. Please refer to that for more details.
