# Assignment 2: Part B - Fine-tuning a pre-trained model
submitted by: Rohit Kumar (DA24S003)

Code related to this part can be found in `finetune_ResNet.ipynb` file. This file is used to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet model on the iNaturalist dataset. The code is based on the PyTorch Lightning framework and uses the `wandb` library for logging and tracking experiments.

This ipynb file was used to run experiments on kaggle with 2 T4 GPUs. While running the code, don't forget to add `wandb_api` as the secret key to login to the wandb account.
